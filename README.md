Breif Introduction to the game:
The 2D-UFO game is based off the roll-a-ball game, but this time it’s in 2D and has a UFO theme. The objective of the game is to collect 12 asteroids in order to win the game.

Instructions on how to play:
In the “Builds” folder of “2D-UFO” there is an executable called "UFO Game Build.exe" double click and play the game in window mode.

You use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the UFO.
Up – move up
Down – move down
Right - move right
Left - move left

When you play the game collect all the asteroids, there are 12 of them.
Once you collected all the coins a text will show "You Win!”.

My Contributions to the game:
I added two sound effects. The first sound effect is the sound of an UFO moving and the second is of an asteroid exploding when collecting the object. I also added a particle effect that trails the UFO. 


What I have learned from the assignment:
From this assignment, I learned how to create simple 2D and 3D games. I also learned how to use Git Bash. Lastly, I learned about scripts and C#.
